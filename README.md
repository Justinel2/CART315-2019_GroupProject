Intro / Game concept:

The initial plan for our island was to insert a boat that would facilitate travelling between the different islands made by class teams. Due to the fact that the game was changed to a group project rather than a class project, we decided to make 3 different islands where objects would interact.
The goal of Survival is self-explanatory, the player embodies a character stranded on desert islands surrounded by shark infested waters. They must survive until the anticipated rescue team arrives.

The gameplay was essentially directed towards time and resource management. The three islands would each have an element to be maintained for the players life. By scavenging food, resting and maintaining the fire and avoiding sharks, the player must preserve the life of the character.

Implementation:

The game was made in an interactive process, meaning ideation and choices were done as the game development progressed. As we developed and tested elements, it was easier for us to understand the game mechanics and how to relate elements to one another.
Due to lack of experience, it was hard to set the team on a clear direction at first. If the game were to be redone, we would begin the process making a clearer outline of gameplay elements and script structure. This would permit teammates to develop elements simultaneously and make a more robust game structure. Although, this might have slowed our creative process. Implementing new elements permitted us to try a variety of elements and test them out together, in the end, we chose to keep those that came together more coherently, such as pick and eat. Furthermore, because some of the script had been developed out of the context of our game, it was sometimes difficult to adapt someone else's script to our personal project, although it did permit us to get a better idea of how things could be programmed and a better idea of unityâ€™s overall features.

Final version / conclusion:

Although the final version is functional and coherent, there are many elements that could be improved. Firstly, this version would require a thorough playtesting in order to identify major bugs and adjust dynamic elements such as player speed, boat speed. Due to the lack of time, we decided to abandon the fire game dynamic, although this would have increased the complexity level of the game. Furthermore, the game would benefit from a certain details such as a sprint option and a more complex mouvement on the part of the chicken.
